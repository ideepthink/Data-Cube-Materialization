## Data-Cube-Materialization
Materializing a data cube using Hadoop MapReduce and Apache Spark

---

This repository is a part of GSOC 2016 project titled **High performance data cube materialization using Apache Spark** under Stony Brook
University Dept. of Biomedical Informatics. <br />

A sample data cube has been constructed using Hadoop MapReduce as well as Apache Spark. 

The Hadoop implementation can be found 
[here](https://github.com/sameer9311/Data-Cube-Materialization/tree/master/src/main/java/org/sbubmi/datacube/hadoop).

The Spark implementation can be found
